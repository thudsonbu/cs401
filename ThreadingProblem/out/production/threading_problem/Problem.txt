Threading Problem

A Magic Number is a positive integer that can be evenly divided by 7, or is evenly divided by 4 and has a last 
digit of 2.

Create 3 threads that each generate Magic Numbers between 10000 and 99999. Each thread is to store the Magic 
Numbers in a collection.

How many unique Magic Numbers are generated in a 5 second time interval?

The main thread has to keep track of time and print out the number of unique Magic Numbers generated. 

Which Magic Number value is generated the most? Do these values change over several executions of the program?

Do this problem using an HashMap first and then a Hashtable. Do they show different results?
