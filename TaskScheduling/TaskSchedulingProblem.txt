PROBLEM:

A task is a some work to be done which can be assumed takes 1 unit of time. Between the same type of tasks you must take
at least n units of time before running the same tasks again.

Given a list of tasks (each task will be represented by a string), and a positive integer n representing the time it
takes to run the same task again, find the minimum amount of time needed to run all tasks.

SOLUTION:

The goal of the problem is the minimize the amount of down time waiting between tasks. We do this by scheduling a
different kind of task during a tasks down time. Thus, the limiting factor is the inability to schedule other tasks
within the one tasks down time. To avoid this, we need to find which task occurs the most because filling in this tasks
down time will be the greatest challenge.

We will begin by reading in each task to a hashmap with the task as the key and the count of that task as the value.
This will give us a constant time read in of tasks.

Next, we will take these tasks and their counts and place them within a priority queue based on the number of times a
task must be scheduled. In Java, priority queues are based on a heap structure and use the natural ordering to
determine where in a heap a specific element belongs. Java's priority queue gives us log(n) time for the adding and
removal of elements which we will do frequently. This is the limiting part of the program in terms of time.

In the Task class we have implemented the Comparable interface which allows us to specify a custom compareTo
method that will be used for the "natural ordering" of elements in our priority queue. Our method does not return equal
as this would not serve a purpose and would increase this operations used for this method.

Using the priority queue we can determine which element should be scheduled next. When an element is scheduled it is
then moved added to a list of elements that are currently in "cool down". Once the downtown of the element has passed,
it is re-added to the priority queue. Each iteration of the outer most for loop represents a unit of time. Thus, each
time the for loop iterates we decrement the remaining cool down time of the elements in the running task list. We use
array lists to keep track of running tasks because we have no idea how many different types of tasks will be used so
initializing an array with specified memory could lead to memory issues later.
