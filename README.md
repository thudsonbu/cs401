# CS401 - Data Structures and Algorithms In Java
## Summary
This repository consists of projects that I created in my two courses on data stuctures and algorithms. The courses covered most common data structures like 
linked lists, binary trees, heaps, stacks, queues, hashmaps, and prefix trees. As for algorithms, many of the most utilized searching, sorting, and hashing
algorithms saw implementations such as linear search, binary search, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, bubble sort, MD5, Sha256 and many others. In addition
to all of this there are also some of the most interesting problems with which a good understanding of algorithms can go a long way in creating an elegant
solution.

## Data Structures
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Heaps
- Hashmaps
- Binary Trees
- Prefix Trees

## Search Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search ( array based )
- Binary Search ( tree based )

## Non Recursive Sorting Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Shell Sort
- Heap Sort

## Recursive Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Hashing Algorithms
- Simple Hash ( mine used for conceptual understaing )
- MD5
- SHA256
- MD5 - used as digital signature

## Implementation Problems
- Hashtable Spell Checker
- Reverse Polish Notation
- Running Median
- Shortest Unique Prefix
- Threading Problem ( server based )
- Tree Level Max Sum
